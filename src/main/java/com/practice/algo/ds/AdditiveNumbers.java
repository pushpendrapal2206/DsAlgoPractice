 * 306. Additive Number
 * <p>
 * Additive number is a string whose digits can form additive sequence.
 * <p>
 * A valid additive sequence should contain at least three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent
 * number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.
 * <p>
 * Given a string containing only digits '0'-'9', write a function to determine if it's an additive number.
 * <p>
 * Note: Numbers in the additive sequence cannot have leading zeros, so sequence 1, 2, 03 or 1, 02, 3 is invalid.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: "112358"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.
 * 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: "199100199"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199.
 * 1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199
